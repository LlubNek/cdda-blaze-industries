This is the first release candidate of Blaze Industries, first committed into the CDDA master repo at about 21:57 GMT on the 3rd of May, 2020, commit number 761e033147d20158a5b05da846132c1714935103 as part of parent 71827cf.
It replaces the original blazemod completely and at time of release so many ID's have been changed that PR's will have to be done for tilesets to bring back parity for visual representation of content.
Nested containers were also committed into experimental around the same time, and so feedback may be delayed while stability is recovered.

This repo exists purely as a point-in-time of initial release.
