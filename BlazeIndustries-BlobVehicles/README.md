Copied from https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-blob-vehicles/commit/a304b05c6ff2194fec9ad5e69372b427004b30d1 on 13 July 2024.

This is a continuation of the blob vehicle parts from a contribution known as blazemod from the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

It is expected that features may be added and removed at will, and there will be no further effort to retain savegame stability for now.

Use at your own risk.
