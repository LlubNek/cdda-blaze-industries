Copied from https://github.com/Soup-de-Loop/CDDA-blaze-legacy-weapons/commit/182358f916bd93a667c35979482dba5770af99ae on 13 July 2024.

This is a continuation of the makeshift weapons and their corresponding vehicle parts from a contribution known as blazemod from the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.
It is expected that features may be added and removed at will, and there will be no further effort to retain savegame stability for now.

Use at your own risk.
